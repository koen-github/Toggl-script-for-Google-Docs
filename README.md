Toggl-script-for-Google-Docs
============================

Importing times from ww.toggl.com directly to Google Docs

First create your own api key (go to Profile in toggl.com), edit the toggl-docs.js and paste your api key.

Create a new script in Google Spreadsheet, paste the contents of toggl-docs, name it and you're done!

If all went well you see after a reopen of the Spreadsheet a new menu option called 'Toggl Times'

Please open a new issue if you have tips, problems or other things!

# Script is dead

I created this script a long time ago, but unfortunately Toggl changed their API, so now this script doesn't work anymore.
There is a good alternative, a plugin for Google Chrome, to get better and more features.
