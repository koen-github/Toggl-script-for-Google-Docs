Toggl-script-for-Google-Docs
============================

Importing times from ww.toggl.com directly to Google Docs

First create your own api key (go to Profile in toggl.com), edit the toggl-docs.js and paste your api key.

Create a new script in Google Spreadsheet and name it.

If all went well you see after a reopen of the Spreadsheet a new menu option called 'Toggl Times'

Please open a new issue if you have tips, problems or other things!
